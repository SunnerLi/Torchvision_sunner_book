### Dataset

In this tutorial, we will use four dataset to do the following explaination:
* Waiting-for-you dataset: There are two different image domain, and contains 1782 and 2039 images, respectively. This dataset will be used in [example1](example1.html) and [example5](example5.html). You can find the dataset in the following link:
```

```
* Single flower-to-flower dataset: There are also two different image domain but in video form. This dataset will be used in [example2](example2.html). You can download from the following link:
```

```
* Ear-Pen dataset: This simple dataset contains the image and pixel-wise segmentation label. This dataset will be used in [example3](example3.html). You can find the dataset here (Just need to download ``train`` and ``test`` folder):
```
https://github.com/SunnerLi/Ear-Pen/tree/master/generate
```

* CityScapes (optional): The ``Torchvision_sunner`` toolkit can also deal with open-source dataset. This dataset will be used in [example4](example4.html). You can find the dataset here:
```

```

After you download the dataset, please place them into ``./Dataset``, and we can start to learn how to use this package!
