## What is Torchvision_sunner?

### Abstraction
``Torchvision_sunner`` is a simple extension of ``Torchvision``. 
However, we create a flexibility toward the image and video.
You can try to load the video or image in a simple way!

### Install
We don't provide the ``PYPI`` installation approach. But don't worried, you can just download the folder of the ``Torchvision_sunner`` folder, and place it into the work folder. The link of the folder is in the following link: 
```
https://github.com/SunnerLi/Torchvision_sunner2/tree/master/torchvision_sunner
```
As the result, when you look around your project, the things might be like this:

```cmd
~/my_project $  ls ./

# The following shows the ls command result
main.py
Torchvision_sunner/
```
